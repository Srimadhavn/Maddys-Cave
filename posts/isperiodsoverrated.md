### Do women lie ?
- When u go to ur gf and ask how she is doing, then she shouts u back for absolutely no fuckn reason.
- So u go to her and ask 'Are u in ur periods or smth ?' why u sound so mad than usual
> Do not try this at home
- then she tell u that 'im on my periods can't u shut up for like a minute'. Then you be like man this ketchup bottle yaps a lot
- From a guy's pov : I get it, yeah it visits you once a month, and yeah it is indeed painful but its a monthly subscription you guys did! 
- A popular study has shown as that most woman tend to act like they are in heavy pain where all they want is attention. 
> Remember : Never do this guys! 

### Is balls pain overrated ?
- I dont know, but imagine, you walk casually thinking what you gonna have for dinner then; 
#  BOOMMMM..
Some random 12 year kid out of nowhere hits u with a mercury (brand) tennis ball, targeted straight at ur balls..
#### You hear glasses shattering
#### Your eyes get blured 
#### You can't hear anything..
After some time, that kid come to and say sorry bro, and goes straight for the ball (mercury one)

You breathe, breathe then you see the world. Then u can barely walk, u cant hold ur balls in the public so u gotta act tuff and walk straight.

### Is comparison necessary ?
- Its valid that sometimes we think that comparing pain of individual is not healthy, we all have our own pains.
- So if any of you guys are going to women and start yapping about how painful balls pain is, then bro you might wanna sit down for this.. **They don't care**.
- In a world we compare between a lot of great things; 
	- Messi vs Ronaldo
	- Dhoni vs Virat
	- CSK vs MI
	- Periods vs balls -> I believe this might be something we should let the future decide.

### Summary
- So, first of all, I feel so sorryyy girls who undergo periods, that 3 days of pain is really brutal. 
			**WHY GOD WHYYYY, WHY DO WOMEN HAVE TO UNDERGO THIS :(((((** 
- By the way ladies, I'm maddy (6'3) and i hate men they are so disgusting, they dont understand women's pain at all. But ladies, why worry when u guys have maddy.! 
- I'm always available at your service, ladies! you can contact me through my instagram and mobile.

> Advice for the boys : Anything to hit ! 

- Take care ladies and gentleman! cya yall in another post!
