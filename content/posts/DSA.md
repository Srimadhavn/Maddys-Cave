**What is DSA ?** : An efficient way to store and manipulate data
	
**Why DSA ?**
- Better problem solving
- Efficient memory management

Types of Data Structures
 - Arrays
 - Linked Lists
 - Stacks
 - Queues
 - Trees
 - Heaps

### Arrays
- A contiguous memory stored Data structure.
- Memory is contiguous meaning there are elements in the consecutive memory space. 

#### **Operations**:
- **Insertion**
	- They are done in the first and last position of the array.
	- in cpp the arrays are dynamic by using 'vector'.

```
		//assume an array named arr
		vector<int> arr = {1,3,5,7,9}
		arr.push_back(11); // this will insert 11 to the last position of the array
		
```
- deletion
- traversing
